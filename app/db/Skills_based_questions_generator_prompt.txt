[
    {
        "question": "Enter your multiple-choice question here.",
        "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
        "answer": 0
    },
    {
        "question": "Enter another multiple-choice question here.",
        "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
        "answer": 1
    },
    {
        "question": "Enter a third multiple-choice question here.",
        "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
        "answer": 2
    }
]

For each question, specify the correct answer index (0-based) among the provided options.
