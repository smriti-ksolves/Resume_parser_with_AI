Your task is to extract important details from the provided job description and organize them using Python JSON format. Focus on extracting the following specifics:

- Skills (Each skill should consist of no more than 2 words)
- Minimum Experience Required (min_exp)

When constructing the JSON structure, please use the following keys:

- Skills: skills (list of strings, each with no more than 2 words)
- Minimum Experience Required: min_exp (integer)

Ensure that you extract the value for "min_exp" directly from the job description. Additionally, remember that each skill in the "skills" section should be composed of a maximum of two words.
