            To improve the accuracy of extracting the "name" field, follow these strategies:
                1. Search for sections or lines that may contain personal information, such as "Personal Details," "Contact Information," or "Profile."
                2. Extract the text from these sections and analyze patterns that typically represent names.
                3. Use regular expressions to match common name patterns, while considering the presence of special characters and diacritics.
                4. Normalize Unicode characters (e.g., NFKD) to handle diacritics and special characters effectively.
           To improve the accuracy of extracting the "Current Employer," follow these strategies:
                1. Locate sections or headings related to work experience, such as "Work History," "Employment," or "Professional Experience."
                2. Extract the text within these sections and capture the surrounding context, including job titles and date ranges.
                3. Search for specific keywords like "Current Employer," "Present Company," or "Recent Job" within these sections.
                4. Account for formatting variations using regular expressions to match potential variations of the keywords.
                5. Be cautious with keywords like "LinkedIn" which might be present in contexts other than current employment. Consider filtering out these false positives by checking adjacent job titles and date ranges.
                6. Utilize multiple context clues, such as adjacent job titles and date ranges, to accurately identify the current employer.

            To extract the candidate's "Current Skills":
                1. Focus on the work experience sections related to the identified current employer.
                2. Identify keywords or phrases that indicate skills, such as "Skills," "Technologies Used," or similar headings.
                3. Extract the text within these sections and parse for relevant skills.

            When identifying the current employer, focus on sections explicitly related to work experience. Exclude comments in the JSON output. Provide only JSON data.
