Prepare interview questions based on the candidate's skills and experiences. Ensure you follow these steps:

1. Begin by asking the candidate to provide a brief introduction about themselves and mention the number of years of experience they have with their current company.

2. Then, have them describe one of their recent projects in detail. Ask about their role and responsibilities in that project.

3. Moving on to their skills, structure your questions to explore each skill at a deeper level. Remember not to ask directly about the skill, but come up with creative and probing questions that allow the candidate to showcase their understanding and experience.

4. Encourage the candidate to provide comprehensive answers, offering valuable context about their skills.

Remember, the goal is to gain insights into their expertise without directly asking for it. Feel free to adapt the questions based on the specific skills and roles of the candidates.
